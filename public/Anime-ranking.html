    Barely surviving in a barrel after passing through a terrible whirlpool at
    sea, carefree Monkey D. Luffy ends up aboard a ship under attack by fearsome
    pirates. Despite being a naive-looking teenager, he is not to be
    underestimated. Unmatched in battle, Luffy is a pirate himself who resolutely
    pursues the coveted One Piece treasure and the King of the Pirates title that
    comes with it. The late King of the Pirates, Gol D. Roger, stirred up the
    world before his death by disclosing the whereabouts of his hoard of riches
    and daring everyone to obtain it. Ever since then, countless powerful pirates
    have sailed dangerous seas for the prized One Piece only to never return.
    Although Luffy lacks a crew and a proper ship, he is endowed with a superhuman
    ability and an unbreakable spirit that make him not only a formidable
    adversary but also an inspiration to many. As he faces numerous challenges
    with a big smile on his face, Luffy gathers one-of-a-kind companions to join
    him in his ambitious endeavor, together embracing perils and wonders on their
    once-in-a-lifetime adventure.

  <p>
    It has been two and a half years since Naruto Uzumaki left Konohagakure, the
    Hidden Leaf Village, for intense training following events which fueled his
    desire to be stronger. Now Akatsuki, the mysterious organization of elite
    rogue ninja, is closing in on their grand plan which may threaten the safety
    of the entire shinobi world. Although Naruto is older and sinister events loom
    on the horizon, he has changed little in personality—still rambunctious and
    childish—though he is now far more confident and possesses an even greater
    determination to protect his friends and home. Come whatever may, Naruto will
    carry on with the fight for what is important to him, even at the expense of
    his own body, in the continuation of the saga about the boy who wishes to
    become Hokage.

  <h3>3.Attack on titan</h3>

  <p>
    Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous
    humanoid creatures called Titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind
    enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that
    their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be
    out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began
    living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a
    single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a
    colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall,
    reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations. After
    witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures,
    Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the
    Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids
    outside the protection of the walls. Eren, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman,
    and his childhood friend Armin Arlert join the brutal war against the Titans
    and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are
    breached.

  <p>
    The all-girls Kikyo Private Academy and Chidori Public High School are polar
    opposites. With its prestigious history, Kikyo is attended by noble young
    ladies from distinguished families, while Chidori is infamously full of
    simple-minded delinquents. It is no surprise that their students clash with
    their differences. Having a tall stature and fierce appearance, Chidori
    student Rintarou Tsumugi is often avoided by others despite his gentle heart.
    One day, while helping out at his family's patisserie, he meets a customer
    who, after a brief moment, runs away from him. The next day, the customer
    returns to apologize to Rintarou, introducing herself as the cheerful Kaoruko
    Waguri. After spending time with Kaoruko, Rintarou appreciates that she does
    not judge him based on his appearance and looks forward to when they will meet
    again. However, when Rintarou discovers Kaoruko attends Kikyo, their
    relationship will challenge the social expectations and dynamics around them.

  <p>
    During their decade-long quest to defeat the Demon King, the members of the
    hero's party—Himmel himself, the priest Heiter, the dwarf warrior Eisen, and
    the elven mage Frieren—forge bonds through adventures and battles, creating
    unforgettable precious memories for most of them. However, the time that
    Frieren spends with her comrades is equivalent to merely a fraction of her
    life, which has lasted over a thousand years. When the party disbands after
    their victory, Frieren casually returns to her "usual" routine of collecting
    spells across the continent. Due to her different sense of time, she seemingly
    holds no strong feelings toward the experiences she went through. As the years
    pass, Frieren gradually realizes how her days in the hero's party truly
    impacted her. Witnessing the deaths of two of her former companions, Frieren
    begins to regret having taken their presence for granted; she vows to better
    understand humans and create real personal connections. Although the story of
    that once memorable journey has long ended, a new tale is about to begin.
